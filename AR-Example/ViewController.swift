    @IBOutlet weak var sceneView: ARSCNView! // 2: Here, we connect the ARSCNView from the Story Board to the ViewController.swift file

In production, you won't have these, but for now, they're useful. We get to see feature points (little yellow dots on unique points in our world) and the World Origin (where ARKit decides is our (0,0,0) (x,y,z)).
        self.sceneView.showsStatistics = true // 5: This shows you statistics about the running program, such as FPS. It's useful for debugging too. For now, we set it to true. In production, we'll want it off.

        self.sceneView.autoenablesDefaultLighting = true // 7: Now that it's running, let's add one more thing: lighting. This sets up a light that AR objects reflect. Default makes the light come from somewhere near origin.
        self.sceneView.delegate = self // DS28: Finally, let's make the sceneview able to interact with itself.

Note that at the end of this file, we've added an extension that allows us to add these two variables using the + command.

                pointer.position = currentPositionOfCamera // DS24: We'll put it at the current position of the camera.
                pointer.geometry?.firstMaterial?.diffuse.contents = UIColor.darkGray // DS25: We'll make it dark gray (and not shiny - no specular here).
